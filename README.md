# A quick and easy NestJS Template

A simple starter template for a NodeJS backend. NestJS along with fastify is used and some industry standards like Prettier, es-lint and Commitlint is added. The starter template is kept relatively clean and simple to have minimal packages included. 

-   `Commitlint and Husky is added for cleaner commits` 

Note:

> This project will be updated bi-yearly, updating all dependencies to the latest version and maybe even replace some tech for newer and better ones or remove deprecated ones.

-   ` Example is included and rest is left for developer decision.`

## Custom Scripts:

```
pnpm start: 'Runs nest dev server with auto reload'
pnpm lint: 'Runs eslint in src directory and fixes all autofixeable errors'
pnpm format: 'Runs src directory through prettier and formats all files'
```
